# Hello, World!

Welcome to my blog.

It's in a state of disrepair right now, but soon i'll use it to write about all
sorts of things; mainly code and games. I've attempted to start a regular blog
before, though none have been very successful. I hope that by broadening the
subject matter and forcing myself to write a bit at a time, hopefully this can
become a staple of my content online.

Let's see how long it takes for me to give up.

The source code for this site is freely available under the terms of the

I haven't decided on a license for the copy itself, but I'll probably end up
going with something equally permissive. For now, assume that the actual stuff
I'm writing here is subject to copyright.
