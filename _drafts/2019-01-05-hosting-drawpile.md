title: "A Greenhorn's Guide to Drawpile"

# Preamble
I'm an artist.

That fact might not be readily apparent from how little I actually draw and
share my work, but I do occasionally dip my toe into it as a hobby, in addition
to creating a lot of my game's visual assets.

I also like playing other people's games over the internet. Though I do tend to
lean towards single player for the most part and lament the loss of games
playable on the same sofa as your opponents, I can't deny how entertaining
online multiplayer can be. Even if the game is simplistic or bad, having other
human beings to laugh and cry alongside you can make a world of difference.

So imagine the shocked expression on my face as one of my many Discord peers
showed me an application that combines both of these interests together, whilst
symultaniously being completely free, decentralised and open source?

Yeah, I couldn't beleive it either, until I tried it for myself.

It's called [Drawpile](http://drawpile.net/), it's amazing, and I'm going to
teach you how you can experience it for yourself.

# A Quick Warning
**Before we begin, I should mention that whilst I'm going to using Drawpile in a
savoury and civilised manner, that doesn't mean everyone else will.**

**Content that could be considered NSFW is available through the program and
while the dedicated servers I'll be using in this guide require users to flag
any such content ahead of time, it doesn't appear to be fully enforced.**

**Proceed with caution when hosting and joining servers with people you don't
know in real life.**

With that out of the way, let's begin.

# Introduction
Drawpile is a digital art application that allows for you and potentially
dozens of other people to draw together on the same canvas over the internet.

If you ever stepped inside the Unovan Union Room circa 2011 and hit the
"draw", it's kind of like that, only with a lot more features, people and room
to draw things.

As a standalone drawing application, it's a little bit on the meagre side,
with only the bare minimum number of tools needed to draw an image. It's being
connected to a server with a handful of other crazy people all creating,
defacing and playing with each other's drawings that it truly comes alive.

You can play pen-and-paper games with this thing. You can watch someone
watch someone draw in real time, absorbing every detail of their technique.
You can take pictures from your browser, paste them onto the page and take it
in turns adding crossed eyes, arrows and funny mustaches to them.

It's great.

Only problem is that despite my aquaintance's insistance to the contrary,
it's not entirely a cakewalk to set up. There are a lot of options and none of
them really come with any explanations as to their function. Whilst I was
eventually able to muddle my way through the process, other people I've talked
to haven't been so successful.
