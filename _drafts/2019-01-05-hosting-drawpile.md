title: "A Greenhorn's Guide to Drawpile"

# Preamble
I'm an artist.

That fact might not be readily apparent from how little I actually draw and
share my work, but I do occasionally dip my toe into it as a hobby, in addition
to creating a lot of my game's visual assets.

I also like playing other people's games over the internet. Though I do tend to
lean towards single player for the most part and lament the loss of games
playable on the same sofa as your opponents, I can't deny how entertaining
online multiplayer can be. Even if the game is simplistic or bad, having other
human beings to laugh and cry alongside you can make a world of difference.

So imagine the shocked expression on my face as one of my many Discord peers
showed me an application that combines both of these interests together, whilst
symultaniously being completely free, decentralised and open source?

Yeah, I couldn't beleive it either, until I tried it for myself.

It's called [Drawpile](https://drawpile.net/), it's amazing, and I'm going to
teach you how you can experience it for yourself.

# A Quick Warning
**Before we begin, I should mention that whilst I'm going to using Drawpile in a
savoury and civilised manner, that doesn't mean everyone else will.**

**Content that could be considered NSFW is available through the program and
while the dedicated servers I'll be using in this guide require users to flag
any such content ahead of time, it doesn't appear to be fully enforced.**

**Proceed with caution when hosting and joining servers with people you don't
know in real life.**

With that out of the way, let's begin.

# Introduction
Drawpile is a digital art application that allows for you and potentially
dozens of other people to draw together on the same canvas over the internet.

If you ever stepped inside the Unovan Union Room circa 2011 and hit "draw",
it's kind of like that, only with a lot more features, people and room to
draw things.

As a standalone drawing application, it's a little bit on the meagre side,
with only the bare minimum number of tools needed to draw an image. It's being
connected to a server with a handful of other crazy people all creating,
defacing and playing with each other's drawings that it truly comes alive.

You can play pen-and-paper games with this thing. You can watch someone
watch someone draw in real time, absorbing every detail of their technique.
You can take pictures from your browser, paste them onto the page and take it
in turns adding crossed eyes, arrows and funny mustaches to them.

It's great.

Only problem is that despite my online aquaintance's insistance to the contrary,
it's not entirely a cakewalk to set up. There are a lot of options and none of
them really come with any explanations as to what they do. Whilst I was
eventually able to muddle my way through the process, other people I've talked
to haven't been so successful.

The purpose of this guide is to teach you how to get up and running as quickly
as possible, using the most straightforward methods I know.

# Requirements
Before using Drawpile, you're going to need a few things:

## A Computer with an Internet Connection
If you're reading this, then congratulations! You've already fulfilled this
requirement.

## A Drawpile Account
In order to use the dedicated Drawpile server, you'll need an account with an
associated e-mail address to confirm your identity. If you don't already have
one, you can register [here](https://drawpile.net/accounts/signup/).

## Other People
This is always the sticking point for any kind of multiplayer anything.

I recommend finding between 2-4 other likeminded individuals, perhaps more,
preferably with some kind of artistic ability; although you can still fun
regardless. No matter who you go with, each of them will also need to have
fulfilled the same requirements as you (having a computer, signing up etc.)

If you're having trouble convincing your friends to join in, there's
[plenty of public rooms available](https://pub.drawpile.net/) that you can jump
straight into.

Not only that, there are untold thousands of internet forums elsewhere in all
shapes and sizes full of people to nag at.

I myself got into it through the [Pixel Art Official](https://discord.gg/Qqm8ANw)
Discord server, and have had a blast playing with those folks, though your
milage may vary.

## The Drawpile Application Itself
You can download the latest version for your computer's operating system and
architecture [here](https://drawpile.net/download/). This is likely going to
be an installer and not a portable executable, so be sure to get that over and
done with before continuing.

## Some Kind of Drawing Tablet
This is optional, but unless your name is Mike Matei, you're probably not going
to want to use a mouse for intricate linework and the like, unless you happen
to find that more comfortable.

# Roles
Drawpile servers are split into rooms (think chat rooms).

There are two key roles when it comes to using Drawpile: the *host* is the one
who creates and manages the room, and the *joiners* (clients) are the people
who connect to the host's room.

If you're lucky, someone in your group will have already volunteered to be the
host with an available room and you'll be able to skip the next portion of this
guide. Otherwise, you're going to need to sort that out before going forward.

## Hosting
So you've voluneered to be the host! Good for you. Being the host is a little
more work than just following a link or code someone gave you, but it'll be
worth it when everyone else is up there drawing alongside you.

To create and host a room, open the Drawpile application:

![A blank Drawpile window]({{ "/assets/drawpile/clean-window.png" | absolute_url }})

on the status bar, click the `Session` tab, and then `Host...`:

![Session dropdown with host hovering]({{ "/assets/drawpile/session-host-dropdown.png" | absolute_url }})

this should make the following window appear.

![Host window]({{ "/assets/drawpile/host-window.png" | absolute_url }})

Let's go over the options. The ones in the `Session` tab affect how the room
is perceived by others in both online listings and the application itself,
whilst the `Settings` lean towards moderation.
