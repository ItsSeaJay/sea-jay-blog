# Hello, World!

Welcome to my blog.

It's in a state of disrepair right now, but soon i'll use it to write about all
sorts of things; mainly code and games. I've attempted to start a regular blog
before, though none have been very successful. I hope that by broadening the
subject matter and forcing myself to write a bit at a time, hopefully this can
become a staple of my content online.

Let's see how long it takes for me to give up...
